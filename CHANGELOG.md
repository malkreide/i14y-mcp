# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added
- Initial release. 13 read-only tools over the I14Y interoperability platform:
  `search_catalog`, `list_datasets`, `get_dataset`, `get_dataset_distributions`,
  `list_data_services`, `get_data_service`, `list_public_services`,
  `list_concepts`, `get_concept`, `search_codelist_entries`, `list_publishers`,
  `list_catalogs`, `api_status`.
- Dual transport: stdio and streamable-http/SSE via `I14Y_MCP_TRANSPORT`.
- Retry with exponential backoff (2s/4s/8s); 4xx other than 429 fail fast.
- Pydantic v2 response envelope carrying `source` and `provenance`.
- Bilingual documentation (EN/DE) and full probe report in `docs/probe-i14y.md`.

### Known findings
Discovered during the live probe on 2026-07-21. Recorded here so the next
server in the portfolio does not have to rediscover them.

- **The search parameter is `query`, not `q`.** Unknown query parameters are
  silently discarded and the endpoint returns the entire index — a 15 MB
  response with HTTP 200. The API never says no; it says everything.
- **`page` and `pageSize` are ignored on `/api/search`.** The complete result
  set is always returned. Capping must happen client-side.
- **The `types` filter on search only works for `Dataset`.** `Concept`,
  `DataService`, `PublicService` and `MappingTable` are accepted without error
  but yield zero results, although those entities exist.
- **The search index covers about 51 % of the register** (1013 of ~2003
  datasets). Search is the entry point, `list_datasets` the completeness
  guarantee.
- **Multilingual nesting is inconsistent.** Themes wrap their language object
  under `name`, keywords under `label`, titles sit directly as
  `{de, fr, it, en}`. A naive extractor leaks a dict into a string field.
  Caught by a live test, not by unit tests.
- **`endpointUrls` may contain entries without a URI**, carrying only a label
  such as «OpenAPI Spezifikation». These are surfaced, not dropped.
- **`/api/concepts/{id}/codelist-entries` returns 405.** Only the `/search`
  subpath exists, and it requires `language` (HTTP 400 otherwise).
- **Read endpoints need no authentication**, despite the OpenAPI document
  declaring a Bearer scheme. Write endpoints do.
